Although the database is already decently sized, we want to grow it even further. We've already covered many common activities but we need your help to expand. Listed here are some guidelines to help with your submission: Activities should start with a verb in the form of a command (ex. &quot;Research ...&quot;, &quot;Invite ...&quot;, &quot;Create ...&quot;) Try to keep the activities general and without references to companies or name brand products  Thank you again so much for your contribution!
